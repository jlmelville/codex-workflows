# ExecPlans

Use an ExecPlan when a future agent must be able to continue from the repository
plus the plan alone.

## Section Skeleton

Use these sections unless the local repo already has a compatible skeleton:

- `Purpose / Big Picture`
- `Current State` or a short status block near the top
- `Progress`
- `Surprises & Discoveries`
- `Decision Log`
- `Context and Orientation`
- `Plan of Work`
- `Concrete Steps`
- `Validation and Acceptance`
- `Idempotence and Recovery`
- `Artifacts and Notes`
- `Outcomes & Retrospective`
- `Interfaces and Dependencies`, when public interfaces or APIs are changing

## Update Rules

Keep the plan self-contained. Name repository-relative files, functions,
commands, fixtures, expected observations, acceptance criteria, non-goals, and
user vetoes. Summarize logs and errors; do not paste long transcripts unless
the exact output is necessary to continue.

Update `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, validation state,
and outcomes whenever work pauses, changes direction, completes a milestone, or
hands off. Put the active state and next action near the top so large plans do
not bury what matters.

Do not record the hash of the commit currently being created in a file included
in that same commit; amending the file changes the commit hash immediately.
Record prior commit hashes in the plan, and report the final hash in chat or in
a later commit.

Use decision entries with this shape:

```md
- Decision: <choice made>
  Rationale: <why this choice fits the evidence and constraints>
  Date/Author: <YYYY-MM-DD> / Codex
```
